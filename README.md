# Tds

[![Hex.pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/tds.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/tds) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/aibnqbukppa3kcpt?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mjaric/tds)

MSSQL / TDS Database driver for Elixir.

Supports Ecto 2.0. It (mostly) implements the [db_connection](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/db_connection) behaviour and has support for transactions and prepared queries.

Please check out the issues for a more complete overview. This branch should not be considered stable or ready for production yet.

## Usage

Add Tds as a dependency in your `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:tds, "~> 1.0"} ]
end
```

When you are done, run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch and compile Tds. Start an interactive Elixir shell with `iex -S mix`.

```iex
iex> {:ok, pid} = Tds.start_link([hostname: "localhost", username: "test_user", password: "test_password", database: "test_db", port: 4000])
{:ok, #PID<0.69.0>}

iex> Tds.query!(pid, "SELECT 'Some Awesome Text' AS MyColumn", [])
%Tds.Result{columns: ["MyColumn"], rows: [{"Some Awesome Text"}], num_rows: 1}}

iex> Tds.query!(pid, "INSERT INTO MyTable (MyColumn) VALUES (@my_value)",
...> [%Tds.Parameter{name: "@my_value", value: "My Actual Value"}])
%Tds.Result{columns: nil, rows: nil, num_rows: 1}}
```

## Features

* Automatic decoding and encoding of Elixir values to and from MSSQL's binary format
* Support of TDS Versions 7.3, 7.4

## Connecting to SQL Instances

Tds supports SQL instances by passing `instance: "instancename"` to the connection options.

## Contributing

Clone and compile Tds with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/livehelpnow/tds.git
cd tds
mix deps.get
```

You can test the library with `mix test`. Use `mix credo` for linting and
`mix dialyzer` for static code analysis. Dialyzer will take a while when you
use it for the first time.

### SQL Server Setup

The tests require an sql server database to be available on localhost.

If you have Docker installed, you can use the official [SQL Server Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server-linux).
To start the container, run:

```bash
./docker-mssql.sh
```

If you prefer to install SQL Server directly on your computer, you can find
installation instructions here:

* [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-installation-wizard-setup)
* [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup)

Make sure your SQL server accepts the credentials defined in `config/test.exs`.

You also will need to have the *sqlcmd* command line tools installed. Setup
instructions can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup-tools).

## Special Thanks

Thanks to [ericmj](https://github.com/ericmj), this driver takes a lot of inspiration from postgrex.

Also thanks to everyone in the Elixir Google group and on the Elixir IRC Channel.
